# macOS Update Processor
__Keep your macOS devices up to date using Declarative Device Management, Jamf Pro, and a SOFA feed.__

## Overview

Let's be real. Keeping macOS devices up to date at scale isn't fun. I know I'm not the only one still occasionally pining for the days of sending `softwareupdate -aiR` over ARD and calling it a day. Unfortunately, those days are gone. Fortunately, this can get close!

Given appropriate API credentials to your jamf tenant, this script will find outdated devices, ensure they're eligible for DDM-based update enforcement, and handle all the dirty work for you.
